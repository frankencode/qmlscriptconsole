h1. The QML Script Console

ECMAScript console plugin for debugging QML applications. Adds a "ScriptConsole" component which opens a script editor window and allows code to executed in that context.

For instance consider:

<pre>
<code>
import QtQuick 1.0
import com.nokia.ScriptConsole 1.0

Text {
    text: "Hello, ECMAScript!"
    ScriptConsole {}
}
</code>
</pre>

Entering "parent.text = 'Hello, echo!'" into the script console allows you to change the text at runtime. The idea is to allow experimenting with ECMAScript expressions interactively.

h2. Build instructions

You need a full Qt >4.7 build environment. For building the plugin enter (from the source folder):
<pre>
<code>
qmake
make
</code>
</pre>

Open the 'test.qml' to check it is working:
<pre>
qmlviewer -I $PWD test.qml
</pre>

You have to pass the plugin path to the QML viewer whenever you want to use the plugin. Check the imports by optionally setting QML_IMPORT_TRACE, like:
<pre>
QML_IMPORT_TRACE=1 qmlviewer -I path/to/qmlscripconsole myapp.qml
</pre>
